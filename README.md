## <a name='overview'>Overview</a>

The second project for General Assembley (GA) Software Engineering Immersive(SEI-Flex) program was to build a React application that consumes a public API.

We have selected [Carbon Cloud API](https://carboncloud.com/climate-footprint-api/) to get products Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). Our application aims to allow users to:
- Display products from various Markets based on the selected production Stage.
- Search for products by name from the rendered list.
- Show Most and Least emissive products from selected categories.
- Add selected products to "Interested In" or "Would like to Avoid" baskets
- Estimate the total impact of products in the baskets.

The app can be viewed [here](https://whatsmyfootprint.netlify.app/).

### <a name='brief'>Brief</a>

The app had to:

* Consume a public API â€“ this could be anything but it must make sense for your project.
* The app should include a router - with several "pages".
* Include wireframes - that you designed before building the app.
* Have semantically clean HTML.
* Be deployed online and accessible to the public.
