We have selected [Carbon Cloud API](https://carboncloud.com/climate-footprint-api/) to get products Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). Our application aims to allow users to:
- Display products from various Countries/Markets based on the selected production stage.
- Search for products by name from the rendered list.
- Show Most and Least emissive products from selected categories.
- Add selected products to "Interested In" or "Would like to Avoid" baskets
- Estimate the total impact of products in the baskets.


# Overview

The second project was to build a React application that consumes a public API.

# The Brief

The app had to:

* Consume a public API â€“ this could be anything but it must make sense for your project.
* The app should include a router - with several "pages".
* Include wireframes - that you designed before building the app.
* Have semantically clean HTML - you make sure you write HTML that makes structural sense rather than thinking about how it might look, which is the job of CSS.
* Be deployed online and accessible to the public.

# Deployment

The app can be viewed here: https://whatsmyfootprint.netlify.app/
